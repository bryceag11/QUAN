# Example evaluation pipeline integration

# Assume you have the following variables from your detection results
# detections: List of torch.Tensor, each tensor of shape (N, 8) for OBBs [x, y, w, h, qx, qy, qz, qw]
# confidences: List of torch.Tensor, each tensor of shape (N,)
# pred_classes: List of torch.Tensor, each tensor of shape (N,)
# target_classes: List of torch.Tensor, each tensor of shape (M,)

# Initialize metrics
det_metrics = DetMetrics(save_dir=Path("./metrics_plots"), plot=True, names={0: 'class0', 1: 'class1', ...})

# Iterate over your dataset
for batch in dataloader:
    # Extract predictions and ground truths
    detections = batch['detections']  # List of tensors
    confidences = batch['confidences']  # List of tensors
    pred_classes = batch['pred_classes']  # List of tensors
    target_classes = batch['target_classes']  # List of tensors
    gt_boxes = batch['gt_boxes']  # List of tensors, shape (M,8)
    
    # Compute true positives (tp) based on your matching logic
    # This typically involves matching detections to ground truths based on IoU thresholds
    # For simplicity, assume tp is a binary array indicating correct detections
    tp = compute_true_positives(detections, gt_boxes, iou_threshold=0.5)
    
    # Update metrics
    det_metrics.process(tp, confidences, pred_classes, target_classes)

# After evaluation
mean_prec, mean_recall, mean_map50, mean_map = det_metrics.mean_results()
fitness_score = det_metrics.fitness
results = det_metrics.results_dict
